    Warfare, construction and destruction literally take place behind screens - under cover - requiring planning and installation. Blueprints were designed. Laws bent and sculpted. Minds both numbed and incited by the media glare of permanent emergency. Troops were deployed as well as architects, TV, checkpoints, internet cuts and bureaucracy. The design of killing orchestrates military, housing and religiously underpinned population policies. It shifts gears across emergency measures, land registers, pimped passions and curated acts of daily harassment and violence. It deploys trolls, fiduciaries, breaking news and calls to prayer. People are rotated in and out of territories, ranked by affinity to the current hegemony. The design of killing is smooth, participatory, progressing and aggressive; supported by irregulars and occasional machete killings. It is strong, brash, striving for purity and danger. It quickly reshuffles both its allies and its enemies. It quashes the dissimilar and dissenting. It is asymmetrical, multidimensional, overwhelming, ruling from a position of aerial supremacy.
