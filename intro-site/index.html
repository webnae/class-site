    <img src="heavens-precious-gift.png" alt="baby girl angel touch star on night sky"><h1>hello, i'm brenae!</h1>
    <p>i use she/her pronouns. i'm an aquarius sun and virgo rising which basically means i'm very cool and very type a.
       in addition to majoring in gdes, i'm also minoring in sociology. everyday after handmade web i go to work at a daycare
       where i look after 1-2 year olds! it's fun having conversations with children with such limited vocabulary; the
       simplicity reminds me of my own design work.</p>
    <h2>pieces of media that have shaped me</h2>
    <p>absorbing music, television and movies, books, and various forms of art have a way of influencing
      our personalities. some people (including myself) may look to their natal chart. in my various journeys of self reflection
      i have found that repeatedly absorbing the same things have helped me internalize ideas, thought processes, creative styles,
      etc. the following list applies to the brenae that i've known since february of 2020, who adopted ideologies and viewpoints
      from past versions of myself but also collected them over the course of this past year and some months. note that this list
      is only a few honorable mentions and most likely neglects things that i see/use everyday but take for granted.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><i>Moana</i> - her dedication to uncovering her truth inspires me daily.</li>
      <li><i>Where U Are by Rina Sawayama</i> - my interpretation of this song has changed over time but it remains a love letter to
      pieces of myself that i will never retrieve nor fully imagine.</li>
      <li><i>Heaven's Precious Gift by Sandra Kuck</i> - there are no words to explain what this painting means to me and my
      inner child.</li>
      <li><i>The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck</i> - my wisdom and creativity are limitless when i listen to my intuition.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>i'd also like to mention that i draw inspiration from various sources. most notably would be my peers - i largely admire every
      person that i've encountered at vcuarts. other artists i adore include keith haring, megan thee stallion, solange, thierry mugler,
      willow, shonda rhimes, and rihanna; all of them are invited to my funeral, except keith who i hope to meet at the gates.
    </p>
